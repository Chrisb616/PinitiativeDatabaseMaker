# Lemon Handshake Database Maker

A companion for the Flatiron team Lemon Handshake's community organization app.

The purpose of this app is to parse through the NYC Open Data info available online via JSON and convert that into information more easily available for users, via Firebase.

This process will include API calls to NYC Open Data, which will store data on the app. That info will then be parsed through by functions to organize the info, and provide new info (i.e. coordinates based off of provided address) and converted into dictionaries. Those dictionaries will then be stored on Firebase for use by the users of the Initatives app.
